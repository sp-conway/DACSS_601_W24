More challenging data may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a brief, high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n## Provide Grouped Summary Statistics\n\nConduct some exploratory data analysis, using dplyr commands such as `group_by()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `summarise()`. Find the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, mix/max/quantile) for different subgroups within the data set. Describe what you find.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
