It allows the user to apply a single function across multiple objects. It can replace for loops with a more readable (and often faster) simple function call. \n\nFor example, we can draw `n` random samples from 10 different distributions using a vector of 10 means.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 100 # sample size\nm <- seq(1,10) # means \nsamps <- map(m,rnorm,n=n) \n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can then use `map_dbl` to verify that this worked correctly by computing the mean for each sample.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsamps %>%\n  map_dbl(mean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 1.159981 1.956878 3.062626 3.891925 5.007970 6.064056 6.971168 7.915584\n [9] 9.006371 9.913220\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`purrr` is tricky to learn (but beyond useful once you get a handle on it). Therefore, it's imperative that you complete the `purr` and `map` readings before attempting this challenge.  \n\n## The challenge  \n\nUse `purrr` with a function to perform *some* data science task. What this task is is up to you. It could involve computing summary statistics, reading in multiple datasets, running a random process multiple times, or anything else you might need to do in your work as a data analyst. You might consider using `purrr` with a function you wrote for challenge 9.  \n\n\n\n\n",
