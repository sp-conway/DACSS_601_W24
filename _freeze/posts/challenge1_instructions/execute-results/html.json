You are only required to do the challenge on one dataset, though you are welcome to do it with multiple datasets.\n\nIn general, I encourage you to \"challenge\" yourself by trying to work with a dataset above your experience.\n\n-   `railroad_2012_clean_county.csv` ⭐\n-   `birds.csv` ⭐⭐\n-   `FAOstat\\*.csv` ⭐⭐\n-   `wild_bird_data.xlsx` ⭐⭐⭐\n-   `StateCounty2012.xls` ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n",
