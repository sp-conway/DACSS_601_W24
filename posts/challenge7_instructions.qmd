## Challenge Overview

Today's challenge is to:

1)  read in a data set, and describe the data set using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)
2)  tidy data as needed.  
3)  mutate variables as needed.
4)  Make at least two graphs using ggplot functionality (color, shape, line, facet, etc), in particular trying to use functionality that you haven't used before.  
   - Explain why you choose the specific graph type.
5) If you haven't tried in previous weeks, work this week to make your graphs "publication" ready with titles, captions, and pretty axis labels and other viewer-friendly features.
