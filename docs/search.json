You are only required to do the challenge on one dataset, though you are welcome to do it with multiple datasets.\nIn general, I encourage you to “challenge” yourself by trying to work with a dataset above your experience.\n\nrailroad_2012_clean_county.csv ⭐\nbirds.csv ⭐⭐\nFAOstat\\*.csv ⭐⭐\nwild_bird_data.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐\nStateCounty2012.xls ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation."
